# Connection: Thingy:91 -> Coiote -> Cloud provider

send data from Thingy:91 to a cloud provider through an integration with Coiote

## Steps
1. Set nRF Asset Tracker firmware to Thingy:91
2. Connect Thingy:91 with Coiote
3. Connect Coiote with a cloud provider

## Discussion

Which cloud providers does Coiote offers as an option for an integration?
AWS and Azure. Both cloud providers are also available to use with Asset Tracker, because the app has support for them. Azure was choosed because AWS integration is not "production ready".
